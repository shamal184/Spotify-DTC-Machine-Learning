**Spotify** is one of the most admired music streaming platoforms in the world. This is a practice project based on a tutorial by Wes Doyle(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfniixfhHqpIGbU7z2JCNJw). An Exploratory Data Analysis is done at first to study the behaviour of each feature and then a Decision Tree Classifier is built to predict the likability of the user.

The key python libraries used
